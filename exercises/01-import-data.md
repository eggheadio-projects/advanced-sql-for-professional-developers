# Import Data

## 01.

Your goal is to bulk import CSV data into the users, purchases, and products tables. 

You will find `[product-data.csv](./product-data.csv)`, `[purchases-data.csv](./purchases-data.csv)`, and `[user-data.csv](./user-data.csv)` in this exercise folder that you can use to import into the `users`, `purchases`, and `products` tables. 

You will have to use the method shown in https://egghead.io/lessons/postgresql-bulk-insert-and-export-data-with-csv-files to complete this exercise.
